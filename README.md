- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
  
- [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

While working on this project I have strengthed my skills on ReactJs (Context API, Hooks, Managing state, search, filter functionality, error boundraries, BrowserRouter, events, making API calls). My javascript skills also improved while working with javascript objects. I also learned how to work with Chakra-UI while working on this project. 


### Continued development

My skills on responsive designs are still very rusty so I plan to focus on improving them. I also look forward to working with more advanced Javascript and ReactJs concepts. 

### Useful Resources

I made extensive use of the [React](https://beta.reactjs.org/) documentation and [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) documentation while working on this project. Stack overflow was also very useful when push comes to shove.

## Acknowledgments

I acknowledge the Frontend Mentor team for making this challenge available for people like us learning and putting the work to become world class someday. If I had access to the figma files I could have done more with the designs though.
